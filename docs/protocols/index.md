Welcome! We are so glad you decided to learn Minecraft Bedrock protocol!

Here you can, and will, learn how MCBE protcol works! It all starts with the [RakNet Protocol](/protocols/raknet) & [NetherNet Protocol](/protocols/nethernet). From those, you recieve the [Bedrock Protocol](/protocols/bedrock). This will guide you and give you proper and up-to-date documentation!

## FAQ

### What is the difference between RakNet & NetherNet?

RakNet is the base transport layer, uses UDP, and is open source. NetherNet is a newer transport layer that is only used for Xbox Live sessions, uses WebRTC, and is built by Mojang (Which means it's not open source).

### Is NetherNet replacing RakNet?

Not entirely, NetherNet is not meant to (and can't) replace all of RakNet. It is only used for LAN games, and any friend games (Xbox or In-Game) which both use to use RakNet.
